### About
This repository is a Project done as part of NTU's Intro to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence course (CZ1115).

### Intro & Problem Statement

With the advent of digital banking services and brokerages offering easy access to retail trading over the past years, the stock market has seen an influx of many first-time investors from the retail sector. Given so, most investors who are inexperienced or uninformed usually make poor decisions with their investments, resulting in losses.

This project seeks to create a data driven approach to selecting stocks based on fundamental data, and removes all price related data. We have taken the stance that past price patterns cannot predict future prices -- the same way you cannot drive a car looking through the rear view mirror!

### Approach
Analyse which stocks in the S&P 500 would be profitable / valuable in the long run based on current fundamental data.
1. By future price prediction (Numeric Prediction)
2. By clustering

### Dataset used
- AlphaVantage API for stock prices, income statements, balance sheets, statement of cashflows and company overview

### Machine Learning Techniques
1. Feature Selection
- Standard Scaler
- KNN Imputer
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

2. Hyperparameter Optimisation
- GridSearchCV

3. Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Artifical Neural Network
4. Unsupervised Learning
- Agglomerative Clustering

### Results

### Key takeaways
